2. Add tomatoes and puree with immersion blender. You can pre-puree with a food processor instead if you want.

3. Add onion chunks and basil sprigs. Let sauce simmer just below bubbling for an hour or so.

4. Let cool a bit and add salt and pepper to taste (don't burn your mouth!) Freeze or use once cool. Aim for room temp when using on the pizza.
