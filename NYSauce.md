### Ingredients
- 28 Oz Can Whole Peel San Marzano Tomatoes
- 1 tb. Extra Virgin Olive Oil
- 1 tb. Butter (if vegan, just use more EVOO)
- Garlic ~2 Cloves
- 1 ts Dry Oregano
- 1 ts Red Pepper (I prefer more, actually and usually do 3-4 ts but only if you're okay with spice)
- 1 ts dry basil or a few sprigs fresh.
- 1/2 lg yellow onion split into quarters
- ~1T Brown Sugar
- Several Pinches Kosher Salt
- Fresh Pepper

### Process
1. Heat oil and butter on medium in a sauce pan. When butter is melted and hot, add garlic. It should bubble. Stir until fragrant about 1 min. Add red pepper, dry oregano, and dry basil (if using). Cook for another minute or so.

2. Add tomatoes and puree with immersion blender. You can pre-puree with a food processor instead if you want. Try to just do short pulses and keep it sort of chunky, not fully pureed.

3. Add onion chunks and basil sprigs. Let sauce simmer just below bubbling for an hour or so. Add brown sugar, salt and pepper to taste (don't burn your mouth!). If you add too much salt, you may be able to balance it out with more sugar, but don't worry about it too much as it gets mellowed out on the pizza.

4. Let cool a bit and freeze or use once cool. Aim for room temp when using on the pizza. I find that it's best to make it a day or two ahead but not necessary.
