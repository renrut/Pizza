# Sourdough Pizza Dough
##This is a WIP recipe.##

### Proportions

| Ingredient  | Size |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Bread Flour | 450g |
| Wheat Flour | 50g |
| Warm Water | 300g |
| Sourdough Starter | 1c |
| Kosher Salt | 15g |
| Extra Virgin Olive Oil | 15g |

### Prepare
Feed your starter the morning of. Alternatively, create a leaven with 50g wheat flour, 50g white flour, 80g of water, and a big spoon of starter. Leaven should be pancake mix consistency.

### Combine
Mix the Sourdough Starter with water. Combine the flour a third at a time and incorporate by stirring with a wooden spoon.  When it's too stiff to stir, use your hands.

### Autolyse
Rest the mixture in a warm space for 45-60 mins for the Autolyse.

### Mix
Incorporate the salt and the oil by kneading it into the dough until well incorporated.

### Knead
Put the dough somewhere warm and use the "fold" method, folding the bread every 20-45 mins for 4-6 folds total.

### Cold Ferment
Rest the dough covered overnight in the fridge for 18 - 20 hours. Lay it out on the table for 20 mins for a bench rest.

### Prepare
Cut into thirds and form balls. Put the balls into their own containers and refrigerate or let the balls rest for around 2 hours. Prepare your ingredients while you wait. 

Once the balls are sufficiently proofed, turn one out onto a floured surface and shape like normal pizza dough.

Top and cook.

### Cook
Cook as you would a normal dough, with the oven maxed out and giving the pizza stone enough time to heat up and reheat in between pizzas.
