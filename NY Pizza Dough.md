# New York Style Dough

This recipe is pretty much a direct adaptation of [Kenji's Pizza Dough](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2010/10/new-york-style-pizza.html).

### Proportions

| Ingredient  | Size |
| ----------- | ---- |
| Bread Flour | 640g |
| Olive Oil | 40g |
| Yeast | 10g |
| Kosher Salt | 10g |
| Sugar | 15g |
| Luke Warm Water | 425g |

### Mix
Combine flour, salt, yeast in a bowl and wisk together until homogenous. Add olive oil and water and mix with hands until shaggy, sticky dough is formed.

### Knead
Turn out dough onto the table and knead. I like to use a bench scraper because the dough is typically quite sticky. Try to resist adding more flour to the mix, unless the dough feels very wet. Knead for a while, and you will feel the dough become less sticky, although it will never become not sticky. You are done kneading once the dough is relatively smooth about 10-15 mins. I can never get mine to pass a full window pane test because I usually get impatient at this point, but it gets close enough. 

### Cold Ferment
Oil your hands and lightly oil 3 deli containers/empty yogurt containers/tupperware. Divide the dough by weight into 3 parts. It should be ~360g per container, but do the math to be sure. Form each into a ball and place seam side down in the container. Put the lid on each container and place in the fridge for __at least 24 hrs__. I prefer 2-3 days in the fridge.

### Prepare
Pull the dough out no more than 3 hours and no less than 1 hour before you want to make pizza. Pull the dough out of each container and reform into a ball. Place each ball seam side down into a __lightly__ oiled soup bowl and let come up to temperature. I typically preheat the oven with the oven stone about an hour before too to help the stone get warm and it warms the dough up.

### Flatten
Put a light but even coating of flour on the kitchen table and pull the dough ball out of the bowl, placing seam side up on the floured surface. Use your fingers to press the dough into a circle, about 8 inches in diameter and a half inch thick, adding more flour if any sticking occurs. Flour the front and back of your hands and pick the dough up and use two fists on the bottom of the dough to stretch it out as evenly as possible. Get it as thin as you can without breaking through. Add extra flour if needed and put dough on the pizza peel.

### Cook
Put toppings on the pizza and shake it onto the preheated pizza stone. Rotate if necessary and cook until the crust has a medium dark brown color on it.
